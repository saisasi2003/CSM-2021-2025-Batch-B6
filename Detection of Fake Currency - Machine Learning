Detection of Fake Currency using Machine Learning Techniques

1. INTRODUCTION
Fake currency is the money produced without the consent of the gov, creation of it is considered as a crime. The 
elevation of color printing technology has increased the rate of fake currency note printing on a very large scale. 
Years before, the printing could be done in a print cafe, but now anyone can print a note with much accuracy 
using a simple laser printer. This results in the printing of fake notes instead of the real ones has been increased 
very much. It is the biggest problem faced by most of the countries including India. Though Banks and other 
large organizations has installed many machines to detect fake currency notes, it is really difficult for an average 
person to distinguish between the two. This has led to the increase of corruption and production of fake notes in
our country hindering our country's growth. Some of the methods to detect fake currency are watermarking, 
security thread, latent image, techniques like counterfeit detection pens. Project aims at observing images taken 
as input that is based on properties taken out after transformation and also on the problem based on machine 
learning. Machine Learning is going to use pattern recognition as well as image processing for analyzing the 
real properties. Therefore, the processes continued with analysis of images, to check their correctness by testing 
the data set with respect of set theory, which will be visible but not mentioned in the model, for achieving 
accuracy. 
2. GENERAL OVERVIEW
Machine Learning techniques help in building applications that support in detection of currency, through 
automated system and algorithm. The aim of this work is to create a paradigm which can be supervised 
with the help of related set theory so that it can be further beneficial in detecting feigned datasets with a 
very few categorizing bugs. Therefore, another name referred as categorizing model grouped as data, 
consisting of attributes and labels for the bills referring as fake or genuine. It identifies decision 
boundaries which separate samples of two classes. 
Since demonetization time it is seen that so much of fake currency is floating in market. In general by a 
human being, it is not possible to identify fake note from the real ones not instead of various parameters 
designed for identification as many features of forged note are similar to original one. In this paper six 
supervised machine learning algorithms are applied on dataset available on UCI machine learning 
repository for detection of Bank currency authentication. To implement this we have applied Support
Vector machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, K- Nearest Neighbor 
by considering three train test ratio 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40 and measured their performance on the basis 
various quantitative analysis parameter like Precision, Accuracy, Recall, MCC, F1-Score and others. 
And some of SML algorithm are giving 100 % accuracy for particular train test ratio [1].
Bank note identification is most important approach based on machine learning and image processing 
method. Many techniques involved in the classification of bank notes carried out experiments on 
separated image data sets of each country’s. Deep learning is machine learning technique that process
the features of original note. In the era of big data where for any real-world application, large amount of 
data has to be processed, deep learning is the superior techniques. In this research, we studied bank n ote 
of various countries by extracting its features in depth and analysis it using deep learning. Our system 
recommended a deep learning-based algorithm to detect Forged bank note through general scanners that 
can be used by persons to prevent personal monetary damages caused by fake bank note [2].
Fake currency is one of the demerits which creates problems to nation's economy and hence impacts the 
growth all over the world. Producing fake currency or producing fake features in the currency is
considered to be a crime. Moreover, the study includes the analysis of widely acceptable statistical 
classification technique for currency authentication. The comparative analysis of Logistic Regression 
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was performed to realize the better model for currency 
authentication. It has been found that classification Model using Logistic regression shows better 
accuracy of 99% then LDA [3].
This paper proposes a method for fake currency recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors followed by
image processing. KNN has a high accuracy for small data sets making it desirable to be used for the 
computer vision task. In this, the banknote authentication dataset has been created with the high 
computational and mathematical strategies, which give the correct data and information regarding the 
entities and features related to the currency. Data processing and data Extraction is performed by 
implementing machine learning algorithms and image processing to acquire the final result and accuracy
[4].
In recent years a lot of fake currency note is being printed which have caused great loss and damage 
towards society. So, it has become a necessity to develop a tool to detect fake currency. This project 
proposes an approach that will detect fake currency note being circulated in our country by using their 
image. Our project will provide required mobility and compatibility to most peoples as well as cre dible 
accuracy for the fake currency detection. We are using image processing and cloud storage to make this 
app portable and efficient [5].
 
Fake currency Identification and Forged Banknote Detection using image processing Banknotes are used 
to carry out many financial activities in banks. There has been a drastic increase in the rate of fake notes 
in the global market. Fake money is a challenge in all of the fields. Given methodology i.e. Fake 
Currency recognition that is based on image processing techniques typically follows some essential 
steps such as image gathering, preprocessing and recognition of the currency. The proposed system work 
on 2 images first is front side of the real image of currency and second is the back side of real image on 
which verification is to be performed. 
3. TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGY
3.1 TECHNOLOGIES USED
3.1.1 Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the processing of computers so they can learn from data. For ex, spam filter is a Machine 
Learning technique that can learn to spam given examples of spam emails and examples of normal mails. The 
ex that the system uses to learn are called the training set. Each training example is called a training set . In this 
case, the task T is to flag spam for new mails, the experience E is the training data, and the performance 
measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the percentage of correctly classified emails. This 
measure is called accuracy and it is often used in classification tasks.
Image processing is the process of converting an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to 
get some important information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals 
when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods. Image processing requires fixed sequences of 
operations that are performed at each pixel of an image. The image processor performs the first sequence of 
operations on the image, pixel by pixel. Once this is fully done, it will begin to perform the second operation, 
and so on. The output value of these operations can be computed at any pixel of the image.
3.2 METHODOLOGY
The Figure 3.1 represents the system architecture of the proposed model. The objective of the design phase is to 
produce overall design of the software. It aims to figure out the modules that should be in the system to fulfill all 
the system requirements in an efficient manner.
 
 
 Figure 3.1- Methodology
Dataset: This dataset contains 500 images of Indian currency notes of different denominations, 250 genuine 
notes and 250 fake notes. The dataset is labeled with information about the denomination and authenticity of 
each banknote. These datasets can be used for training and testing machine learning algorithms for fake 
currency detection. However, it is important to note that the performance of the algorithm depends on the size 
and diversity of the dataset, as well as the quality of the images and the labeling process. It may be necessary to 
augment the dataset or collect additional images to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. 
Pre-processing: Pre-Processing is an important step in any machine learning task as it can significantly affect 
the accuracy of the model. Here are some steps for pre-processing data for fake currency detection using the 
decision tree algorithm:
• Data Collection: Collection of real and fake currencies. This can include images of currency notes, videos of 
people exchanging currency, and other related information.
• Data Cleaning: Check the data for missing values, outliers, or other errors. You may need to remove or correct 
some data points to ensure accurate results.
• Data Encoding: Convert the data into a suitable format that the decision tree algorithm can understand. For 
example, you can convert images into numerical arrays or encode categorical data using one-hot encoding.
• Feature Selection: Identify the most important features that can help the decision tree algorithm differentiate 
between real and fake currency. This can include features like watermark, security thread, texture, and serial 
number. 
• Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the decision 
tree model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
• Data Normalization: Scale the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale. This can help the decision 
tree algorithm make accurate predictions. 
• Data Augmentation: Increase the size of the dataset by adding variations of the existing data. This can include 
flipping images, rotating them, or changing the lighting conditions. 
• Data Balancing: Ensure that the dataset has an equal number of real and fake currency examples. If the dataset 
is imbalanced, the decision tree model may be biased towards the majority class.
Canny Edge Detection: Canny edge detection is a popular algorithm for detecting edges in images, which can 
be used as a basis for image segmentation. It converts the image to grey scale. Gray scaling is a technique used 
in image processing and computer vision to convert a color image into a grayscale image. In the context of fake 
currency detection, grayscale images can help identify patterns and features in banknotes that are not easily 
visible in color images.
Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is an important step in preparing data for machine learning algorithms. 
Here are some features that can be extracted for fake currency detection using the decision tree algorithm:
• Watermark: A watermark is a design that is embedded into the paper of a currency note. Real currency notes 
have a distinct watermark that is difficult to replicate. The decision tree algorithm can be trained to identify the 
presence or absence of a watermark and its characteristics, such as its shape, size, and position. 
• Security Thread: A security thread is a thin strip that is embedded into the paper of a currency note. The thread 
can be made of plastic or metal and has a unique pattern that is difficult to replicate. 
• Texture: The texture of a currency note can be analyzed to detect if it is real or fake. Real currency notes have 
a distinct texture that is difficult to replicate. The decision tree algorithm can be trained to identify the texture of 
a currency note by analyzing features such as the spacing of the lines and the depth of the engravings.
• Serial Number: Each currency note has a unique serial number that is printed on it. The decision tree 
algorithm can be trained to identify the format of the serial number and its position on the note.
VGG 19 Model: VGG-19 is a CNN that consists of 19 layers . We can upload a version of the network trained 
on about a million images from various database . The required network can classify images into different object 
categories, such as keyboard, mouse, monitor, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich 
feature representations for large number of images. The network has an image input size of 224 X 224
5. CONCLUSION

projected approach is tried by 100% recognition faux detection accuracy and therefore the low price 
(near about1) of mean sq. error.

conferred technique into a mobile application, in order that its proving to be a larger use. the appliance 
areas which will be helpful through the projected approach embody faux currency detection whereas 
electronic currency exchange and cash deposit victimization ATM.
